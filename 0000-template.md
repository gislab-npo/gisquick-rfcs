# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed description

Describe how project's author or end user will be using this feature.
If more significant changes in UI are needed, it's better to design mockups.

# Detailed design

Analysis and technical details written by programmer(s) indended to implement
this feature. Should contain info about required changes in current system,
like server API, QGIS plugin, web application, infrastructure (Docker, DB, ...).

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- breaking changes

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
